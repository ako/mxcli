# Proposal: mine Mendix's diagnostics catalog for `mxcli check`

**Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-07-18
**Relates to:** `PROPOSAL_check_mxbuild_gap_heuristics.md` (one *tactical* slice of this —
6 specific constructs), `PROPOSAL_expression_type_checking.md` (Tier B enabler),
`PROPOSAL_mxcli_dev_warm_loop.md` (this catalog fronts the warm loop's build).

## Problem Statement

`mxcli check` reports "Check passed" for many constructs that the real MxBuild
(`docker build` / `mx check`) then rejects. Each miss costs a full build round-trip
(~30–60 s) to discover — and in the warm-dev-loop world (`PROPOSAL_mxcli_dev_warm_loop.md`)
it's the difference between an instant gate and a ~0.8 s build. The gap is currently
closed **reactively**, one rule at a time, whenever someone hits a build error.

Mendix already ships the complete list of things it will reject: a **diagnostics catalog**
embedded in `Mendix.Modeler.Texts.dll`. This proposal mines it into a **target list** so
`check`/`lint` coverage becomes a measured, prioritised program instead of a reactive one.

## BSON Structure

Not applicable — this is a static-analysis/tooling proposal. It reads Mendix's build-tool
assemblies (design-time), not app `.mpr` documents.

## Research findings (verified this session)

**Where the catalog lives.** `Mendix.Modeler.Texts.dll` embeds GNU-gettext `.po` resources
named `problem-descriptions_<locale>.po` (en-US primary, plus deprecated/test variants and
5 translations). They *are* the catalog.

**Format — already structured, not free text.**
- `msgid` = `CODE__SUMMARY`, e.g. `CE0001__ASSOCIATION_BETWEEN_PERSISTABLE_...`.
- `msgstr` = a **parameterised template** with named `{PLACEHOLDER}` tokens (and
  pluralisation tokens like `{S_IF_PLURAL}`), not runtime-assembled fragments.
- **Severity is encoded in the prefix**: `CE` = Consistency Error, `CW` = Warning,
  `CI` = Info. No inference needed.
- Each entry carries a `# LOCATION: <SourceFile>.cs` comment and an optional
  `# NOTE: MX_DOCS_CAT:<category>` docs-deep-link tag.

**Scale (Mendix 11.12.1, primary en-US PO):** **1318 codes** — 1265 `CE` + 53 `CW`
(`CI` codes live mostly in the deprecated/test POs); **727/1318 are parameterised**.
Present identically in 11.6.3 and 11.12.1.

**Static-checkability tiering** (heuristic, by message + source subsystem):

| Tier | Share | Nature | `mxcli check` reach |
|------|-------|--------|---------------------|
| A | ~60% (791) | structural / reference / required-property / naming | direct — model already parsed |
| B | ~26% (338) | expression / type-inference / XPath | needs a type-inference pass (`PROPOSAL_expression_type_checking.md`) |
| C | ~9% (120) | cross-document / datasource / client-compat | whole-model graph analysis |
| D | ~5% (69) | runtime / platform / tooling state | **not** statically checkable — skip |

Subsystem split (by source file): Microflows 364, Domain model 275, Pages/Widgets 248,
Integration/REST/OData 129, Security 29, Workflows 15, Navigation 7.

**mxcli already does ~6% of this by hand.** The source references **~77–81 distinct
`CE`/`CW` codes** across ~24 `validate_*.go` files and ~30 lint rules — proof the approach
works; the catalog just turns "port as we hit them" into an ordered backlog of ~1240 left.

**There is no cheaper Mendix-native shortcut.** `mx check` (consistency only, no build)
measured **~22 s** — *slower* than an incremental build — because both cold-start the .NET
model engine + load the full `.mpr`. So mxcli's Go-native `check` is the **only** path under
the ~18–60 s floor. That is the entire justification for porting rules into Go rather than
shelling out to `mx check`.

## Extraction methodology

Reproducible, ~1 min, no Studio Pro. The **script is ours; its output is Mendix's corpus**
(see § Open questions on IP). Committed as `scripts/extract-diagnostics-catalog.sh`:

```bash
# 1. stream just the one assembly from the Mendix CDN (no full mxbuild download)
curl -s "https://cdn.mendix.com/runtime/mxbuild-${VERSION}.tar.gz" \
  | tar -xz --occurrence=1 modeler/Mendix.Modeler.Texts.dll

# 2. extract the embedded PO resources (needs mono-utils → monodis)
monodis --manifest   Mendix.Modeler.Texts.dll   # lists the .po resources
monodis --mresources Mendix.Modeler.Texts.dll   # writes each resource to a file

# 3. parse problem-descriptions_en-US.po into structured rows:
#    code, prefix→severity, slug, message-template, {params}, source .cs, MX_DOCS_CAT
#    then tier each by static-checkability. (Python parser in the script.)
```

`msgid` → `(prefix, number, slug)`; prefix → severity; `{...}` tokens → parameter list;
`# LOCATION:`/`# NOTE:` comments → source file + docs category. Output: `catalog.csv` /
`catalog.json` (local only). Re-run per Mendix version to refresh.

## Representative examples (verbatim, small fair-use sample)

```
CE0001  error  An association between a persistable entity and a non-persistable entity
               must start in the non-persistable entity and have owner 'Default'.
CE0002  error  Owner must be 'Default' for self-referential associations.
CE0006  error  An XPath constraint on an access rule on {DESCRIPTION} is not allowed,
               because it is not persistable.

CI1561  info   Path parameter 'x' does not appear in the path ''.
```

Plus the production-security rule this session actually hit and fixed with one `grant`:
*"At least one allowed role must be selected if the page is used from navigation, a
button, or a URL."*

## Proposed approach

1. **Ship the catalog as a versioned data asset** — `sdk/versions/diagnostics-{version}.json`,
   produced by the extraction script per Mendix version. Lets `check`/`lint` emit
   **Studio-Pro-identical codes + messages + severities**, a UX win even before new rules.
   (Subject to the IP decision below — may ship code IDs + our own message text rather than
   Mendix's verbatim strings.)
2. **Port by tier then frequency.** Tier A first (cheapest, highest hit-rate), Tier B behind
   the type-inference work, Tier C case-by-case, Tier D never. Route `CE`→`check` (hard),
   `CW`→`lint` (advisory) — severity is free from the prefix.
3. **Harvest-against-the-oracle loop.** Use `mx check` (~22 s, the full 1318-code truth) as
   an **offline oracle** over a corpus of deliberately-broken projects; diff its findings
   against `mxcli check`; the misses are the ranked backlog; port; re-run to confirm parity.
   This is the build tool for the porting effort, and reuses the "run mxbuild over broken
   projects and harvest output" fallback from the very first spike as a *deliberate* tool.
4. `PROPOSAL_check_mxbuild_gap_heuristics.md` is the first tactical instance; this proposal
   is the strategic program it fits into.

## Implementation Plan

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `scripts/extract-diagnostics-catalog.sh` | New: the reproducible extractor (stream DLL → `monodis --mresources` → parse+tier). Committed here. |
| `sdk/versions/diagnostics-{version}.json` | Generated catalog data asset per version (IP decision pending). |
| `mdl/linter/rules/`, `mdl/executor/validate_*.go` | Port Tier-A codes, prioritised by frequency; cite the `CE`/`CW` code in each. |
| `mdl/executor/…` (oracle harness) | Offline `mx check` vs `mxcli check` parity report over a broken-project corpus → ranked backlog. |
| `mdl-examples/check-gap/` | Broken-project fixtures feeding the oracle harness. |

## Version Compatibility

- Codes are stable across 11.6.3 / 11.12.1; the extractor is version-parameterised, so the
  catalog refreshes per Mendix release. Register generated assets alongside the existing
  `sdk/versions/mendix-{9,10,11}.yaml`.
- New/removed codes between versions are themselves a useful signal (what Studio Pro started
  or stopped checking).

## Test Plan

- Extractor: unit-test the PO parser against a small committed fixture PO (our own, not
  Mendix's), asserting code/severity/params/location parsing.
- Oracle harness (gated, needs mxbuild): for each broken fixture, assert `mxcli check` now
  reports the same code `mx check` does — parity regression per ported rule.
- Each ported rule: a `mdl-examples/check-gap/` fixture + a `validate_*`/lint test.

## Open Questions

1. **IP / licensing (blocking the data-asset shape).** The message *text* is Mendix's
   proprietary copyrighted content extracted from their DLL. Committing all 1318 verbatim
   into the repo is redistribution. Options: (a) ship only **code IDs + severity + source +
   our own paraphrased messages**; (b) generate the full catalog **locally at build time**
   from the user's own licensed mxbuild (never committed); (c) confirm redistribution is
   permitted. Default: **(b)** — commit the extractor, not the corpus.
2. **`monodis` dependency.** The extractor needs `mono-utils`. Alternatives: `ilspycmd`
   (dotnet tool) or a small pure-Go PE manifest-resource reader to drop the mono dep.
3. **Tiering is heuristic.** The A/B/C/D split is keyword+subsystem-based; the real
   per-rule trigger predicate lives in Mendix's `.cs` (the `LOCATION` breadcrumb) and must
   be reverse-engineered per rule. The catalog gives the *target + message*, not the
   predicate — sizing must account for that.
4. **Overlap with `PROPOSAL_check_mxbuild_gap_heuristics.md`.** Fold that proposal's 6 cases
   in as the first harvested batch, or keep it separate and cross-link? (Recommend: keep it
   as the tactical pilot; this proposal owns the methodology + backlog.)
