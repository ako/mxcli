// webclient_legacy_paths.go recognises one mxbuild failure that only ever
// appears under --watch, and only on Mendix 11.14+.
//
// On 11.14 the FIRST build in an `mxbuild --serve` process succeeds and every
// SUBSEQUENT build in that process fails, because the first one does not leave
// the deployment in a state its own incremental build can continue from. Two
// artifacts are missing, and which one the build dies on depends on how far it
// gets before it needs them:
//
//	the bundler's config file   web/rollup.config.mjs or web/rspack.config.mjs
//	the per-document client     web/pages/, web/layouts/
//
// Measured against mxbuild 11.14.0 driven directly over its HTTP API — no
// mxcli in the picture — on a blank app, POSTing the SAME /build request twice
// with the model untouched between them:
//
//	build 1   Success
//	build 2   Failure — ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND for web/rollup.config.mjs,
//	                    imported from mxbuild's own tools/node/rollup-runner.mjs
//
// It is not the app's choice of bundler. With App Settings > Runtime > App
// bundler flipped to Rspack the shape is identical, naming the other file:
// "Failed to load Rspack configuration file … web/rspack.config.mjs". So
// switching bundlers is not a workaround.
//
// Nor is restoring the deleted config, which was worth ruling out because the
// config IS recoverable: it appears on disk for ~1.5s mid-build and carries
// nothing model-specific (no page list, no widget list, no hashes; its input is
// just index.js, with page discovery delegated to a rollup plugin at build
// time), so it could be captured and put back the way `mxcli fix widgets`
// harvests mxbuild's own output. Measured, that rescues only the case nobody
// needs:
//
//	build   model      state                     result
//	1       -          cold                      Success
//	2,3     unchanged  config restored           Success
//	2'      CHANGED    config restored           Failure - missing web/pages/*.js
//	3'      CHANGED    config restored + dirs    Failure - widget export
//
// So there are two regressions, not one. The config deletion is the visible,
// recoverable half; underneath it the per-document client export expects
// deployment state 11.14's cold build no longer produces, and supplying the
// missing directories only moves the failure to exporting two pluggable widgets
// that ship with a blank app. Across 2' and 3', web/dist/index.js never moved
// off its cold-build timestamp. Nothing outside the process fixes that half,
// which is why this file reports rather than repairs.
//
// The controls that place this in mxbuild rather than here: a one-shot
// `mxbuild --target=deploy` run TWICE into the same deployment directory
// succeeds both times (so the 11.14 deployment shape is not the trigger — a
// fresh process is happy with the directory a serve process chokes on), and
// mxcli's /build request carries exactly the four fields mxbuild advertises in
// its own error response.
//
// What mxcli can do is not let the failure read as the user's model being
// broken. The message names absolute paths inside deployment/ and nothing
// about why they are missing, so the natural response is `rm -rf deployment/`
// — which costs a cold build and changes nothing, because the next second
// build fails the same way.
