// diag_loop_report.go answers "where did this session's mxcli calls go?".
//
// It exists because the cost of an agent-driven session is dominated by the
// NUMBER of tool calls, not by their output: every model call re-reads the whole
// conversation, so total cost is calls x conversation size, and when a removed
// call takes its tool output with it the total falls with the square of the call
// count. A measured comparison of the same class of app built with mxcli vs on
// Vercel put the gap at 4.25x the model calls and 5.4x the conversation re-read.
// See docs/11-proposals/PROPOSAL_agent_loop_efficiency.md.
//
// Every mxcli invocation already writes a session_start record naming its argv
// (mdl/diaglog), so the distribution of calls is on disk and nobody has looked.
// This turns "the loop feels expensive" into a ranked list, and — run before and
// after a change — into evidence that the change worked.

Every mxcli invocation writes a session record naming its argv, so the shape of
an agent's loop is already on disk. This reports it: which commands were run,
how often, how long they took, and how many did not exit cleanly.

A run that fails exits through os.Exit and writes no summary record, so it is
counted as "did not close" rather than as a failure — the report says which it
is measuring rather than presenting one as the other.

It counts mxcli PROCESSES, not model calls — one shell command can run several.
Read it to find which command dominates a loop, and re-run it after a change to
see whether the loop actually moved.
