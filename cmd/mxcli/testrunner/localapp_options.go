// which log they read, so everything else — ports, the scratch database, and
// the constant values the app runs with — is decided in one place. It was the
// constants that made this worth sharing: they were absent from both runners,
// so a suite saw a different value under `--local` than the same suite saw
// under `--attach` (which runs against an app `run --local` booted, with the
// configuration's values applied). Nothing errored; the assertion just ran
// against the wrong constant. See docs/11-proposals/PROPOSAL_constant_values.md.
