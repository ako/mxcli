# Project Brain

`mxcli brain` records the project knowledge mxcli **cannot** compute. Two halves:

- **Decisions** — why a pattern was chosen here, which marketplace version broke
  what, what a recurring mxbuild error means in *this* app.
- **Open questions** — what is not decided yet, recorded so it is not silently
  forgotten and rediscovered expensively later.
- **The plan** — the requirements being built from, grouped into slices, when the
  source is a specification document, a prototype or a conversation.

The plan half exists because that source leaves **no trace in git**. A Word
document, a Figma file and a chat window are not an issue and not a commit
message, so hours of work can end with nothing recording what it was for — and a
session resuming tomorrow has no idea what it was building towards.

It is opt-in. A project without `docs/brain/` never hears about it. `mxcli`'s
bootstrap interview asks for requirements by default.

## The rule

**Anything mxcli can answer does not belong in the brain.** Entities,
microflows, pages, bindings, references and callers are all queryable. A note
that transcribes any of them will disagree with the project the moment someone
edits the model — and it will disagree silently, because nothing checks prose.

The brain stores only the negative space: the reason, the constraint, the
history that no query can reach.

## Layout

```
docs/brain/
  README.md              what the folder is
  project.md             cross-cutting decisions
  modules/Sales.md       decisions anchored to the Sales module
  modules/Finance.md     …
  plan/01-accounts.md    requirements for one deliverable slice
  plan/02-approvals.md   …
```

Committed, and reviewed in a pull request like any other change.

The split is not cosmetic. A single file would make the size cap a project-wide
budget — recording a `Sales` decision would compete with a `Finance` one — and
every session would load every module's decisions. With one file per module, a
session loads `project.md` plus the shards for the modules it is touching.

## Anchors

An entry's anchors are what make it routable and checkable.

| Anchor | Names |
|---|---|
| `@Sales` | a module |
| `@Sales.Order` | a document: entity, microflow, page, workflow, … |
| `@Sales.Order.Status` | a member: an attribute |

The **first** anchor decides the file: `@Sales.Order` puts the entry in
`modules/Sales.md`. An entry with no anchor is cross-cutting and goes to
`project.md`.

There is no index to maintain — the module prefix *is* the file name.

## Workflow

An agent captures; a person promotes.

```bash
mxcli brain init -p app.mpr

mxcli brain capture "Orders are committed by Finance, not Sales" \
  -a @Sales.Order -a @Finance.ACT_Post -p app.mpr

mxcli brain staged -p app.mpr      # review the queue
mxcli brain promote a1b2c3 -p app.mpr
```

Captures go to `.mxcli/brain/staged.jsonl`, which `mxcli init` git-ignores — so
nothing reaches a pull request until someone has looked at it. `mxcli lint`
prints a one-line reminder when the queue is not empty.

The queue is deliberately not sharded: routing it would force the file decision
before a human has looked at the entry, which is the decision promotion exists
to make.

## Checking

```bash
mxcli brain check -p app.mpr             # every shard
mxcli brain check --changed -p app.mpr   # only shards this branch touched
```

Two independent things are checked.

**Does each anchor still resolve?** Three outcomes, one of which is a failure:

| Outcome | Meaning | Fails |
|---|---|---|
| resolved | the anchor names something that is there | no |
| **not found** | the anchor names nothing — the entry is stale | **yes** |
| not indexable | the target exists, but its document type is not in the catalog's index | no |

The third state matters. The catalog's `objects` view covers the describable
document types, not all of them. Without this distinction an anchor to, say, a
scheduled event would read as *missing*, and `check` would demand edits to
entries that are perfectly current. mxcli separates the two with a
type-agnostic unit lookup that cannot miss a kind, because it never asks what
kind anything is.

**Is each entry in the right shard?** A separate axis, not a fourth anchor
state: every anchor can resolve and the entry still be in the wrong file. At
least one anchor must belong to the shard the entry sits in; anchors into other
modules are reported but do not fail, because a fact like "`Sales.Order` is
committed by `Finance.ACT_Post`" genuinely spans two modules.

Misfiling is only decided when something resolved. An entry whose anchors are
all *not indexable* is left alone — there is no evidence about where it belongs.

## Requirements and slices

When the source of truth lives outside git, record it before building:

```bash
mxcli brain capture "Orders must be approvable by a manager" \
  --slice 02-approvals -a @Sales.ACT_Order_Approve -p app.mpr
```

`--slice` is the only signal needed: it files the entry in `plan/02-approvals.md`
and makes it a requirement. Slices sort by name, so a numeric prefix is how a
roadmap is sequenced — that is your choice, not a field mxcli maintains.

### A requirement's anchor points forward

| | Anchor points at | An anchor that does not resolve means |
|---|---|---|
| decision | what exists | the decision is **stale** — `check` fails |
| requirement | what is intended | **not built yet** — normal, `check` passes |

Same syntax, opposite meaning. Anchoring a requirement at a microflow that does
not exist yet is correct: it is the forward reference that later becomes the
progress signal.

This is not a theoretical distinction. Recorded as an ordinary entry, a single
unbuilt requirement takes `mxcli brain check` to exit 1 — which is what made
requirements a separate kind rather than more entries in the same files.

### Progress is derived

```bash
mxcli brain plan -p app.mpr
```

```
SLICE           BUILT  PLANNED   UNANCHORED
01-accounts         1        0
02-approvals        0        1            1

1 of 3 requirements built, across 2 slice(s).
```

A requirement is **built** when its anchors resolve against the model. Nothing in
the file says "done": create the microflow a requirement points at and the count
moves on the next run, with the plan file untouched.

That is the reason this belongs in mxcli rather than in a hand-kept markdown
checklist. A status column is wrong the moment someone builds something, and
nothing tells you; a derived one cannot be.

A requirement with **no anchor** is counted apart as *unanchored* rather than
silently called planned — it cannot be measured until you say what will
implement it.

Misfiling is not checked for slices: a slice spans modules by design.

## Open questions

An open question is a decision that has not been made yet.

```bash
mxcli brain capture "Do approvers see rejected orders?" --open -a @Sales.Order -p app.mpr
```

Its **anchors are not checked**. A question may name something that does not
exist — often the question is precisely whether it should — so the staleness
rule that keeps decisions honest would report every question as a defect.
Measured: the identical anchor takes `brain check` to exit 1 as a decision and
exit 0 as a question.

`--open` combines with `--slice`. A question about a slice's scope is filed with
that slice and counted apart from its requirements: an unanswered question is
not outstanding scope, so it never inflates the slice's numbers.

Answering it converts it in place:

```bash
mxcli brain resolve <id> "Yes, for 30 days
Agreed with the product owner; drives the overview filter and the access rule."
```

The entry keeps its **id** and its position in the file, and the question
survives as the answer's context. From that moment its anchors are checked like
any other decision — which is the whole point of the transition, and is asserted
by a test.

Both `brain check` and `mxcli lint` report unanswered questions until one is
resolved. A question nobody answers is the one kind of entry that gets more
expensive the longer it sits.

## When to capture a decision

Capture needs a trigger, not good intentions. The reliable one:

> **You have had to correct the same thing twice.**

The second correction is the signal — it will happen a third time, to someone
else. The other trigger is choosing between real alternatives where the losing
one would look reasonable to the next person: record the choice *and* what ruled
the other out, or it gets re-litigated.

## Size

```bash
mxcli brain show -p app.mpr
```

```
SHARD              ENTRIES    LINES     HEADROOM
project.md               3       28      92/120
Administration.md        2       16     224/240
```

Each shard has a line budget and `promote` refuses rather than exceeding it,
naming the shard and its occupancy. `project.md` is the tightest: it is the only
file loaded every session, so every line in it is charged to every session.

A plan slice gets far more room — it holds source material and is read when
planning rather than loaded every session. It is still a budget, and that is the
point: **a slice too long to read is a slice that should be split.** Here the cap
does not merely bound context cost, it enforces the slicing discipline.

When a promotion is refused the answer is to condense or drop, not to raise the
cap. The cap is what stops the store becoming a file nobody reads.

Sizes are computed on every run and are deliberately not written into any
committed file, including the store's own `README.md` — a figure in prose is
stale the next time anyone promotes.

## Commands

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `brain init` | Creates `docs/brain/`. Refuses a `docs/brain/` it did not write |
| `brain capture "<text>" [-a @Anchor]…` | Queues an entry. Never commits |
| `brain staged` | Lists the queue with the shard each entry would land in |
| `brain promote <id> [--to <shard>]` | Writes it into its shard |
| `brain drop <id>` | Removes it from the queue or from its shard |
| `brain capture "<text>" --slice <name> [-a @Anchor]…` | Queues a **requirement** of that slice |
| `brain capture "<text>" --open [-a @Anchor]…` | Queues an **open question**; anchors not checked |
| `brain resolve <id> "<answer>"` | Answers it, turning it into a decision in place |
| `brain plan` | Each slice's requirements counted against the model |
| `brain check [--changed]` | Anchors resolve, entries filed correctly, plus slice progress |
| `brain show [<shard>]` | Entries, lines and headroom per shard |

Dropping the last entry from a module shard deletes the file, so the directory
does not accumulate husks that read as "this module has decisions".
