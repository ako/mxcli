# Pluggable Widgets Across Mendix Versions

Modern Mendix UI is built from **pluggable widgets** — DataGrid 2, Combo box, Gallery,
the data-grid filters, and any widget you install from the Marketplace. mxcli can create
and configure these widgets in a page, and it does so in a way that stays correct as the
installed widget versions change from project to project. This guide explains how that
works and how to inspect what mxcli has discovered about a widget.

## The problem: "the definition of this widget has changed" (CE0463)

Every pluggable-widget instance stored in an `.mpr` embeds a copy of the widget's
**definition** — the full list of properties, their types, default values, captions,
categories, and declared order. When you open the app, Studio Pro (and `mx check`)
compares that embedded definition against the widget package (`.mpk`) actually installed
in the project. If they differ in any way, you get:

> **CE0463** — "The definition of this widget has changed. Update this widget by
> right-clicking it and selecting 'Update widget'…"

Different Mendix versions — and different Marketplace releases of the same widget — ship
slightly different definitions: a property is added, an enumeration option is renamed, a
category moves, the property order changes. A tool that emitted one fixed definition would
trip CE0463 the moment the project's widget version didn't match.

## How mxcli stays version-correct

mxcli never hard-codes one widget shape. It reconciles a known-good template against the
widget package **installed in your project**, so the definition it writes matches the
version you actually have at the moment you create the widget.

1. **Embedded template.** mxcli ships a known-good template for each built-in widget
   (extracted from Studio Pro). This provides the correct nested BSON structure that is
   hard to build from scratch. A widget with **no** embedded template — anything from
   the Marketplace, and the Charts family — is instead generated whole from the
   package (`GenerateFromMPK`), so an embedded template is not a prerequisite for
   support.

2. **Reconcile against the project `.mpk`.** When you pass a project (`-p`), mxcli finds
   the widget's `.mpk` in the project's `widgets/` folder, parses its definition, and
   updates the template to match: it adds and removes properties, rewrites enumeration
   option sets, fixes categories/captions/defaults, fills in per-property metadata, and —
   importantly — **re-orders the properties to the package's declared order**, including
   the system properties (Label / Visibility / Editability) at their real position. This
   is exactly what Studio Pro's own "Update widget" does, derived generically from the
   package with no widget-specific code.

3. **Apply the widget's own dynamic rules.** Which properties a widget shows depends on
   its *configuration* — a Combo box in enumeration mode hides the association properties;
   a DataGrid 2 with selection off hides the selection labels. That logic lives in each
   widget's compiled `editorConfig.js`. mxcli statically extracts those **dynamic property
   rules** and applies them, so a freshly-created widget carries exactly the defaults
   Studio Pro would give it.

The result: widgets created by mxcli open cleanly across Mendix 10.x and 11.x with the
widget packages bundled with those releases — verified on Mendix 11.12 with Data
Widgets 3.4: a project authored entirely by mxcli reports **0** CE0463.

### Two things this does *not* cover

**Upgrading a widget package does not update widgets you already created.** A package
that drops a property leaves every *stored* instance carrying a property the new
definition no longer has — which is what CE0463 reports, and what its message
("Update all widgets") asks you to fix. This is normal Mendix behaviour and it is not
specific to mxcli: Studio Pro's own widgets are flagged identically. Measured on
Mendix 11.12, upgrading Data Widgets 3.4 → 3.11.3:

| Project | as authored | after the upgrade | after `mx update-widgets` |
|---|---|---|---|
| a real mxcli-built app | 0 errors | 36 CE0463 (7 mxcli-authored, 29 Studio Pro's own) | 0 errors |

mxcli has no "Update all widgets" equivalent yet. Until it does, run the update in
Studio Pro. Avoid `mx update-widgets` on an MPR v2 project — it collapses
`mprcontents/` back to the single-file v1 layout.

**Two widgets do not yet author cleanly against Data Widgets 3.10+.** Freshly created
`gallery` and `dropdownfilter` widgets produce CE0463 on those packages; `datagrid2`,
`textfilter`, `datefilter` and `numberfilter` are clean. Tracked as
[mendixlabs/mxcli#716](https://github.com/mendixlabs/mxcli/issues/716). On the
bundled 3.4 package all of them are clean.

## Inspecting the discovered widget format

Two commands let you see exactly what mxcli knows about the widgets available to a project.

### List available widgets

```bash
mxcli widget list                 # built-in widget definitions
mxcli widget list -p app.mpr      # also loads project-specific definitions
```

### Describe one widget

`mxcli widget describe` shows a widget's **expected properties** and its **dynamic property
rules**. Name the widget by its MDL keyword (`COMBOBOX`, `DATAGRID2`, `GALLERY`, …) or its
full widget id.

```bash
# mxcli's built-in view of the widget:
mxcli widget describe COMBOBOX

# the version-accurate view from the package installed in the project:
mxcli widget describe COMBOBOX -p app.mpr

# machine-readable:
mxcli widget describe DATAGRID2 -p app.mpr --format json
```

With `-p`, the properties and rules come from the widget package actually installed in the
project (`widgets/*.mpk`) — the version-accurate "discovered" format, and the only way to
inspect a Marketplace widget mxcli has no built-in knowledge of. Without `-p`, they come
from mxcli's embedded template.

Example (abridged):

```text
Widget: Combo box (combobox)
  ID:      com.mendix.widget.web.combobox.Combobox
  Version: 2.5.0
  Kind:    pluggable
  Source:  project .mpk

Properties (58):
  source                 enumeration required default=context {context|database|static}  (General::Data source)
  optionsSourceType      enumeration required default=association {association|enumeration|boolean}  (General::Data source)
  attributeEnumeration   attribute required  (General::Data source)
  …
  selectAllButtonCaption textTemplate required  (General::Multiple-selection (reference set))
  Label                  system  [system]
  Visibility             system  [system]
  Editability            system  [system]
  customEditability      enumeration required default=default {default|never|conditionally}  (General::Editability)
  …

Dynamic property rules (10):
  itemSelectionMethod       hidden when itemSelection = "None"
  keepSelection             hidden when itemSelection ≠ "Multi"
  loadMoreButtonCaption     hidden when pagination ≠ "loadMore"
  …
  — 7 of 23 editor hide-rules recognized
```

The property list is in the widget's **declared order** (system properties appear where the
package declares them, not appended at the end), each with its type, whether it's required,
its default, enumeration options, and category. Object-list widgets (e.g. DataGrid 2
columns) show their nested item properties indented. The dynamic rules read as
"property *X* is hidden when *Y*", and the trailing coverage line reports how many of the
widget's editor hide-rules mxcli recognized.

### `--format json`

Both the properties and the rules are available as JSON for scripting:

```json
{
  "widgetId": "com.mendix.widget.web.combobox.Combobox",
  "version": "2.5.0",
  "source": "project .mpk",
  "properties": [
    { "key": "source", "type": "enumeration", "required": true, "default": "context",
      "enum": ["context", "database", "static"], "category": "General::Data source" }
  ],
  "dynamicRules": [
    { "property": "loadMoreButtonCaption", "hiddenWhen": "pagination ≠ \"loadMore\"" }
  ]
}
```

## Reconciling stored widgets after a package upgrade (`mxcli widget sync`)

Everything above keeps a widget correct **as it is authored**. When you later upgrade
the widget package, the instances already stored in your pages go stale and Mendix
reports CE0463 on each one. Studio Pro fixes this with "Update all widgets"; mxbuild
has `mx update-widgets`, which works but **destroys `mprcontents/`** on an MPR v2
project, collapsing it to a single-file v1 layout.

`mxcli widget sync` is the equivalent that preserves the v2 layout:

```bash
mxcli widget sync -p app.mpr --dry-run     # preview; names every property
mxcli widget sync -p app.mpr               # apply
```

It reconciles **schema** — properties the package added, dropped or redefined — and
never changes a property value you set. It skips any widget whose `.mpk` is not
installed rather than guessing.

**This is partial today.** On the reference fixture (Data Widgets 3.4 → 3.11.3) it
clears 7 of 40 CE0463 errors where `mx update-widgets` clears all 40. The widget
*type* it writes is byte-identical to Mendix's own output; a value-level difference
that has not yet been identified keeps DataGrid2 and Gallery instances erroring.
Preview with `--dry-run` and confirm with `mx check` before relying on it. Applying
currently needs `MXCLI_ENGINE=legacy`; `--dry-run` works on either engine.

Each unit is verified for duplicate GUIDs before being written, and the run aborts
rather than writing one. This matters because Mendix validates GUID uniqueness only
when *saving*: a duplicate loads fine and passes `mx check`, then breaks the next save
— and `mx update-widgets` collapses `mprcontents/` before it discovers the problem,
leaving the project both flattened and unloadable.

## Marketplace and custom widgets

`mxcli widget describe -p app.mpr <widget-id>` works for **any** widget installed in the
project, including Marketplace and custom widgets mxcli has no embedded template for — it
reads the definition and editor rules straight from the installed `.mpk`. To teach the
page builder to author a custom widget from MDL, extract a definition for it first:

```bash
mxcli widget extract --mpk widgets/MyWidget.mpk    # writes a .def.json
mxcli widget init -p app.mpr                        # extract defs for all project widgets
```
