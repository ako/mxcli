## What this is

A pluggable widget stores two coupled structures: the **type** (the PropertyTypes
schema — what properties exist) and the **object** (the WidgetObject — the values).
Studio Pro requires them to correspond exactly: every PropertyType needs its
WidgetProperty, every `TypePointer` must resolve, ordering must match, and no
field may appear that the reflection schema does not declare. Any deviation is
CE0463 *"the definition of this widget has changed"* — which on a master-detail
page cascades into CE3637 on the dependent DataView.

Nearly fifty findings carry this code, which makes it the most-reported single
error in the repo. It is expensive out of proportion to its frequency, and the
reason is in the wording: **CE0463 names the widget *version*, and is caused by
almost anything in the widget's stored BSON.** The error points at the one thing
that is usually fine.

## How it fits

**Two unrelated bugs wear this error, and separating them is the first move.**
Either the widget *package* changed after the widgets were authored — a stored
instance now carries a property the new definition dropped, which is what Studio
Pro's "Update all widgets" exists for and is **not an mxcli defect** — or the
widgets were authored against the current package and mxcli emitted something it
does not accept. The two are indistinguishable in `mx check` output. Two controls
tell them apart: whether Studio Pro's *own* template widgets fail alongside yours,
and whether `mx update-widgets` clears it. Skipping that step produces a confident
wrong answer, and has.

**The default measurement hides the class.** `mxcli docker check` runs
`mx update-widgets` first, on purpose, to suppress exactly the package-drift noise
above — so it reports 0 errors on a project that genuinely has a CE0463, *and*
repairs the project on the way past, leaving it clean for any later check too.
Both of this cycle's real CE0463s were invisible until someone passed
`--no-update-widgets`. (`mxcli check` is not an alternative: it validates an MDL
script and never invokes mxbuild, so it cannot produce CE0463 at all.)

**The cause is usually a value, not the schema** — four of five fixes in one
release cycle were value-shaped while the error named the version: an empty
`TextTemplate` where Studio Pro stores the attribute name, an empty
`Forms$ClientTemplate` where Studio Pro stores `null`, a placeholder `" "` for an
unset string. Property-set drift against the package is real but a weak predictor:
one widget needs nineteen additions and passes, while another is byte-for-byte in
sync and fails.

**A difference from the reference is not a cause.** With one grid's type
byte-identical to `mx update-widgets` output, twenty-five value-level differences
remained; three were patched in isolation and none moved the error count. The diff
*bounds* the search, it does not rank it — budget for that rather than
pattern-matching the first plausible entry.

**A visibility rule must be evaluated against the configuration that will be
written, never the one the package declares.** The two diverge precisely on
unmapped properties, which is the only place the rule matters — which is how every
mxcli-authored Image widget failed a build while the package's own defaults said
it should not. The corollary for fixtures: a test whose helper restates the
default under test is not a fixture, it is the hypothesis wearing a test's
clothes.

**Where a property is an enumeration, compare against the package's
`enumerationValue` *keys*, not its captions.** Both sides are plain strings, so
nothing else compares them and a caption-shaped value is stored and built without
complaint until Studio Pro reads it. A wrong value hidden inside the default
configuration will also not reproduce at all — vary the property that unhides it,
or the measurement is of nothing.

**The drift recurs because the two structures are written from different code
paths**, and the definitions themselves exist in more than one copy (the embedded
set, the modelsdk set, and the project's own `.mxcli/widgets/`). A fix applied to
one copy is latent in the others — the same [[duplicate-resolver-drift]] shape,
here in data rather than code.

**`mx check` is the wrong gate for this class.** It is tolerant of both extra and
missing properties; `mx diff` and Studio Pro are strict, and Studio Pro runs
`mx diff` internally when opening a project with uncommitted changes. A green
check does not mean the project opens.
