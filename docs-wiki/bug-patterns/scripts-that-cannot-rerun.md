## What this is

mxcli's writes are idempotent — a unit whose content has not changed is not
written at all. Its *statements* are not, and the two get conflated. `create`
follows SQL convention and fails on an existing object; `alter entity … add
attribute` fails when the attribute is already there. Five `mdl/grammar` findings
are the consequence, and the compounding one is that `exec` halts on the first
error.

Put together: **a domain script that is 90% already applied applies none of the
remaining 10%.** The first `add attribute` that already exists ends the run, and
every later statement — including the new ones — is skipped. The user's reading is
usually that mxcli is broken, because re-running a script is the natural way to
converge a project on a description of it.

## How it fits

**The silent variant is worse than the error.** `alter entity … add index` did
not fail on a re-run: it reported "Added index" and appended a duplicate, and the
build then rejected the project. An error that stops the script is recoverable; a
success that corrupts is not, and the two live in the same statement family.

**Non-idempotence is a design decision, not a bug — but it has to be
discoverable.** MDL is SQL-shaped deliberately, and `CREATE TABLE` failing on an
existing table is the behaviour that shape implies. What was missing was the
signpost: the bare "already exists" error did not name `create or modify`, and
the idempotent spellings existed without being reachable from the failure.

**Two remedies, and they answer different questions.** `IF NOT EXISTS` /
`IF EXISTS` on a statement says *this one is optional*, which is what a
converging domain script wants. `exec --continue-on-error` says *attempt
everything and tell me what failed*, which is what a partially-applied script
wants — and it must still exit non-zero, or it trades a stopped run for a hidden
failure.

**Watch for the pair that cannot both be re-run.** `ADD EVENT HANDLER` errors
when the handler exists and `DROP EVENT HANDLER` errors when it does not, so
neither a plain script nor a defensive drop-then-add is re-runnable. A statement
family needs the guard on both halves or the workaround is unavailable too.

**Put the guard where the family is, not on each member.** `IF EXISTS` arrived
one statement at a time — attribute, index, enum value, user role, demo user —
each with its own AST field and handler branch, and the document-level `DROP`
(35 doctypes) still had none. It now lives once: the grammar rule on every
alternative, one flag the visitor sets, and one check in the executor's
dispatch. That is safe only because every drop handler reports a missing
target the same way (`NotFoundError`, at lookup, before mutating), which a
table test over every bare `DROP` measures. A new drop handler that says "not
found" some other way fails that test rather than silently erroring under the
guard.

**A list rule without a separator reads as a value error.** Several parse
failures in this area were reported against the *value* in the second item of a
list — `add attribute A: integer default 9, add attribute B: …` — when the list
rule simply had no comma alternative. When a parse error names something that is
plainly valid in the first position, suspect the list before the value.

**`create or modify` of a flow is re-runnable only if it matches its own
output.** A flow statement is diff-then-patch: it is compared with the stored
flow, and under `mdl 1` a difference the splice cannot make is refused rather
than rebuilt. So every way the comparison can fail to recognise *the flow the
same statement built* turns into a script that cannot be run twice (#839,
#859: 36 refused statements in one project's second pass). Comparing statements
with describe's rendering of the stored graph kept failing on spellings — a
guard clause printed as if/else, a shared merge printed as `join`/`merge`, a
wrapped row printed as crossed sections. What settled it was comparing what the
statement *builds* with what is stored (read back through the codec, element
IDs aside): the builder is deterministic, so an identical re-run matches by
construction. The property that catches the class runs **authored** scripts
twice (`TestFlowRerunProperty`); a describe → exec property cannot, because it
only ever feeds describe's own spelling back. The comparison is only as
good as the reader both sides pass through: a property the reader drops
compares equal on both sides, so an edit to it was reported Unchanged (a
`show page … with title` override). The read back therefore proves itself
lossless — written again, it must be the document first written — and falls
back to the statement diff when it is not.

**The statement diff still decides every flow that does change**, and there
two more ways to be unrunnable showed up (#859). A default describe omits —
`on error rollback` — has to be read as absent on the declared side too, or the
activity is re-spliced with every sibling edit; the built-graph match hides that
on an identical re-run, so the probe is a sibling edit and the splice summary.
And a refusal of a *legitimate* change is, to someone re-running a script,
indistinguishable from non-idempotence: re-annotating an activity was refused on
every run until the splice could replace an activity's notes. The header-only
upgrade (a mdl 0 description under `mdl 1;`) is where both surface on Studio
Pro content, because a backslash escape in a note is a real change under mdl 1.

The same failure has a structural cousin: an AST field that records how a
statement was **spelled**, kept for a deprecation or lint note, is compared like
a stored property unless it is named as spelling (`spellingFields`; an empty
`else` goes through `canonicalFlow` instead, because the `if` shell compare
needs `HasElse`). `commit … with events` never matched its stored bare commit
(#942). It is not cosmetic. The diff groups adjacent unmatched statements into
one run, and the loop-body refusal was asked only of a run of one. So a
spelling difference next to a loop turned a refused loop-body edit into a silent
replace of the loop, with every `$ID` in it re-minted. When you add an AST flag,
ask whether describe can print it. Refusals have to hold for any run that pairs
a stored loop with a new body, whatever else changes next to it.

**Some re-runs only reach a no-op across two statements.** `revoke all` followed
by the grant that should hold ends with the rules it started with, but each
statement is a real write of its own. The grant's write was compared with a unit
the revoke had already emptied, so it had no stored rule to carry an identity
from, and the rule was minted again on every run (#872). Making each statement
more idempotent does not help here. What fixed it was judging the run by where
it ends: the writes are held, and they are reconciled once against the state
from before the run. Read the transaction id as well as the unit bytes to see
that a run wrote nothing. Check the identity carry on a Studio Pro-authored rule,
because an mxcli-created one has whatever `$ID` the previous run minted.
