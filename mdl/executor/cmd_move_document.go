// Before #932 MOVE accepted nine doctypes. The other twenty-odd were not
// unimplemented, merely unlisted: a top-level document's move is one
// containment row whatever the document is, so the work per doctype was a
// grammar entry and a lookup, not new machinery. Rather than write that lookup
// twenty more times — each one a `List<Kind>()` scan that can only find the
// kinds someone remembered to add — this resolves the name through the unit
// table, which is type-agnostic by construction.

// mdl/types/unit_types.go says JavaScript actions live under "JavaActions$",

// Hence the deliberate asymmetry: refuse only when the derived kind is itself a
// doctype MOVE knows how to spell. A kind mxcli has no MDL word for — a page
// template, a document type a future Mendix version adds — is a derivation this
// code cannot vouch for, so it defers to the name lookup. Document names are
// unique within a module, so that lookup is the authority; this check is here to
// catch a mistyped doctype, not to second-guess the model.
