// is what `DESCRIBE ENTITY` emits — and extractSelectClause could only read the
// select-first one, so feeding a describe straight back to `check` reported
// `could not parse select clause from OQL query` on a query Mendix itself had

//
// Every test here pairs the from-first query with its select-first twin as the
// control: the two must be read and judged identically, or the fix is only
// moving the blind spot.
