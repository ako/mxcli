// validateMenuItemIcons (MDL077) flags a navigation menu item that specifies no
// icon.
//
// # Why this is worth a warning
//
// Mendix's navigation sidebar collapses to an icon rail, and that is the state
// most users leave it in. A collapsed item shows its icon; an item without one
// falls back to the first few characters of its caption, which is rarely enough
// to tell "Orders" from "Order lines". The menu still builds, `mx check` passes,
// and the only symptom is a column of truncated words in a browser.
//
// The icon is optional in the grammar and nothing said anything about leaving it
// out, so an iconless menu was the easiest one to write.
//
// # Every item, at every depth
//
// A sub-item is a menu item: it renders in the flyout the collapsed rail opens,
// and a submenu's PARENT sits directly on the rail, so it needs one most of all.
// The rule is uniform rather than scoped to the top level — if that proves noisy
// on a deep menu, narrowing it is a one-line change to the walk, but reporting
// too little is the failure that is hard to notice.
//
// # A warning, not an error
//
// The project builds and runs. This is a usability defect, not a broken model,
// and `exec` refuses only on errors — a rule that blocked the script would make
// an opinion about design into a gate.
//
// # It needs no project
//
// The icon's PRESENCE is in the script; only its target has to be resolved
// against the project's icon collections, and MDL-ICON01 already does that
// separately. So this runs in the project-free pass and fires under
// `mxcli check` with no `-p` — which is how CI runs it, and how the four widget
// rules that were inert in CI got missed.
