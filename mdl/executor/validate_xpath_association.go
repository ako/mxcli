// An association named in an XPath constraint must be written QUALIFIED
// (`Module.Association`); an attribute is written bare. Get it wrong and mxcli
// stores the constraint faithfully, `mxcli check --references` passes, `exec`
// reports success, and mxbuild fails the build with
//
//	ERROR at <Module>, Microflow '<MF>', Retrieve object(s) activity
//	'Retrieve list of <E> from database': Error(s) in XPath constraint.
//
// Measured on a blank Mendix 11.14.0 app, with the qualification as the only
// variable between two runs of the same script:
//
//	[Ticket_Reporter = $currentUser]                 check passed  →  build exit 3
//	[MyFirstModule.Ticket_Reporter = $currentUser]   check passed  →  BUILD SUCCEEDED
//
// This is the expensive shape rather than a cosmetic one, because `exec` applies
// statements one at a time and cannot roll back: a script carrying this in the
// middle writes everything before it and stops at the build, leaving the model
// half-updated with nothing having reported a problem.
//
// The rule is deliberately narrow. It fires only on a bare name that is NOT an
// attribute of the constrained entity AND IS a known association, so it can say
// which spelling to use instead of merely suspecting one. A name that is neither
// is left alone — that is a different error (an unknown member), and guessing at
// it here would produce false positives on every XPath function and keyword.
// That same narrowness is why no keyword list is needed: `and`, `or`, `not` and
// `contains` are not association names, so they cannot match.

// xpathIdentRe matches an identifier and the character before it, so the caller
// can reject a qualified tail (`.Name`) or a variable (`$var`). RE2 has no
// lookahead, so the character AFTER the identifier — which distinguishes a
// module prefix from a member — is inspected by index instead.
