// mendixlabs/mxcli#1018 has 26 statement types in scope — every one that accepts
// a `/** … */` doc comment AND has a rewrite path. Three are fixed. This test
// exists so the other 23 are a number somebody can read rather than a thing that
// was quietly not done: patching the reported instances and leaving the class is
// the failure the wiki calls duplicate-resolver-drift.
//
// It fails when a statement type gains a rewrite flag and a Documentation field
// without either carrying the presence bit or being listed below. Adding a new
// doctype therefore has to make a decision about documentation, rather than
// inheriting the bug by default.

// docCarryDone are the statement types whose rewrite path preserves an unstated
// doc comment. Move a type here when its executor carry lands AND
// TestDocumentation_SurvivesRewrite covers it.
