// DESCRIBE -> exec must not destroy a menu icon.
//
// # The failure this pins
//
// Measured on testdata/expr-checker, whose Home item carries a glyph icon:
//
//	describe  menu item 'Home' page …;
//	          -- icon a numeric glyph code (Forms$GlyphIcon) is not reproducible …
//	exec      Navigation profile 'Responsive' updated.
//	describe  menu item 'Home' page …;        <- comment gone: the icon was DELETED
//
// CREATE NAVIGATION is a full replacement, so an icon the writer could not emit
// was an icon the statement removed. Exit 0, success message, silent loss — the
// same shape as the pluggable-widget body loss in mendixlabs/mxcli#1036.
//
// # Why this test is at this layer
//
// The round trip is describe -> parse -> write, and the defect lived in the fact
// that the three stages disagreed about what an icon IS. Asserting on the MDL
// text is what catches that: the emitted clause has to carry enough to rebuild
// the SAME element, not merely something that parses.
