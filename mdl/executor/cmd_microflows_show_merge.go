// Labelling merges for DESCRIBE, so a rejoin can be written down.
//
// A Mendix ExclusiveMerge has no name. MDL's `merge <label>` / `join <label>`
// invents one for the length of a description, which is what lets DESCRIBE emit
// a graph whose paths do not nest.
//
// The case this exists for is an ERROR path that rejoins the normal one. Before
// it, `collectErrorHandlerStatements` stopped dead at the merge and emitted an
// empty `on error … begin end error` block — MDL that re-executes to a DIFFERENT graph, with
// no warning. Measured: repointing SUB_Feedback_SendToServer's error edge from
// the tail merge to an upstream one produced byte-identical MDL, and executing
// it reproduced the tail-merge graph.
//
// Scope is deliberately narrow. Only merges an error handler rejoins are
// labelled — not every irreducible split, which still gets the #923 warning.
// A label emitted where the nested description already reproduces the graph
// would be noise, and worse, would churn the describe output of every project.

// The crossed set is carried here rather than threaded as a second parameter
// because the label alone does not say how a merge is emitted, and the two
// emissions are opposites:
//
//   - a rejoin merge is DECLARED where the traversal meets it, because the

// droppedMergeWarnings flags every ExclusiveMerge the description does not

//
//   - the join point of an exclusive/inheritance split, rendered implicitly by
//     `end if` / `end split`;
//   - a labelled error rejoin, rendered explicitly as `merge <label>`; and
//   - any merge with two or more incoming flows, which is a genuine convergence
//     the describer renders as the continuation of whatever construct it closes.
//
// That last one is not redundant with the first, and the case that proves it is
// a split where one branch `return`s: findMergeForSplit needs a join common to
// ALL branches, so it finds none, yet the merge is still emitted as the
// continuation after `end split` and survives. Measured on
// Administration.ManageMyAccount (Administration 4.3.2), whose merge keeps its
// $ID across describe → exec; without the in-degree clause it is a false
// positive, and a warning that cries wolf on ordinary Marketplace code is worse
// than no warning.
//
// What is left — a merge with a SINGLE incoming path — is walked straight
// through by the describer and represented by nothing at all. Measured across
// the microflows of a blank 11.14 app plus FeedbackModule: every one-input
// merge is deleted by describe → exec (7 of 7) and every other survivor keeps
// its $ID. It is behaviourally harmless (a one-input merge is a no-op) but it
// deletes a node the user drew, which is what guard-don't-drop exists to
// prevent. MDL-FLOW01 does not cover it: the graph is perfectly reducible, so
// the irreducibility detector is right to stay silent and something else has to
// speak.
//
// Deliberately NOT covered here: a merge lost to the flattening of an
// IRREDUCIBLE graph (one two-input merge of
// FeedbackModule.SUB_Feedback_SendToServer goes this way). That microflow
// already carries MDL-FLOW01, which says the description is not equivalent and
// must not be re-executed at all — a strictly stronger statement than this
// warning, and the right owner for it.
