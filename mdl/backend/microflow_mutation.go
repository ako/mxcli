// MicroflowFragment is what an `alter microflow` insert or replace splices in:
// the objects and flows a fragment of MDL builds to, written exactly as
// `create microflow` writes the same statements, and the two objects the
// surrounding flow connects to. Entry is where the flow into the fragment
// ends; Exit is where the flow out of it starts. For a one-activity fragment
// they are the same object.
//
// Positions are the builder's own; the mutator translates the fragment into
// place (plan item 4.2c) before writing it.
