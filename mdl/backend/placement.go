// DocumentPlacementBackend moves top-level documents between containers, and
// finds them without being told their type.
//
// Placement is the one property every document type shares and none of them
// stores: a document's folder is its unit's container, not a field in its
// contents. So the typed Move* methods on the per-domain interfaces
// (MoveMicroflow, MoveEnumeration, …) all reduce to the same row update, and a
// new document type inherits a placement bug simply by not having one written
// for it — which is how import mappings, JSON structures, queues, scheduled
// events and a dozen others ended up unable to leave the module root (#932).
//
// These two methods are type-agnostic on purpose. FindDocumentUnit resolves a
// qualified name through the unit table rather than through a per-kind list, so
// it cannot inherit the blind spot that a hand-maintained list of document
// kinds keeps re-introducing (cf. #892, where the same kind of list made a
// non-empty folder render as empty and a destructive drop look safe). The typed
// Move* methods stay for the doctypes whose move does extra work — remapping
// document access roles, rewriting cross-module references.

	// MoveDocument reparents a top-level document unit to containerID, which is

	// Implementations must be idempotent: moving a document to the container it
	// already occupies must not write. Placement changes nothing inside the
	// unit, so it is invisible to content-based no-op elision (ADR-0008) and has
	// to account for itself.
