// Site is one translatable text together with where it sits: the nearest

// document type. The catalog's string index used to reach five sites because
// each one was hand-written against a typed reader (page titles, enum captions,
// three microflow activities); the walk below reaches every site in the project
// with no per-type code — 17 distinct ones in a stock 11.13 app, and whatever a
// future Mendix version adds, for free.

	// an enumeration's twelve values into one and calls the set complete as soon
	// as any one value is translated.
