// Reconcile is ADR-0008 decision 1, as a single decision both storage engines
// share: given the bytes a write wants to store and the bytes already stored, it
// returns what should actually be written and whether the write can be skipped.
//
// Why a *canonical* comparison rather than comparing bytes: the rebuilt bytes
// always differ, because every sub-element in a rebuild gets a freshly random
// $ID. Byte comparison would skip nothing.
//
// Skipping is strictly safer than writing, not merely cheaper. Canonical
// equality means the two documents differ only in which IDs they picked, and the
// stored ones are the IDs every pointer inside that unit already agrees with —
// so keeping them cannot dangle a reference, whereas rewriting them is how
// PR #125 made projects unopenable. Nothing outside the unit can observe them:
// of 9,910 binary $ID pointers in a real project, 0 cross a unit boundary.
//
// Every failure path falls through to writing. A false "different" costs a
// redundant write, which is the behaviour that existed before this function; a
// false "equal" would silently discard the user's intent.
//
// Callers pass stored == nil for a unit that does not exist yet.
// Option adjusts what Reconcile carries. Variadic so every existing caller —
// the common rebuild case — is unaffected.

// languages were never expressible and carrying them back restores what the
// statement could not say. A targeted PATCH of the stored bytes is authoritative:
// it started from the stored translations and any that are missing are missing

// every client-callable microflow's operation id from it:
//

//
// verified against deployment/model/operations.json. Regenerating it on every

//     writing.
//
// The patch is byte-for-byte in place: a BSON binary value is fixed-width, so
