# Changelog

All notable changes to mxcli will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Marketplace download & install** — the content API now returns a per-version `downloadUrl`, so the previously-parked install path is unblocked. `mxcli marketplace download <id> [--version X] [-o file]` fetches a content version's `.mpk` (two-step: MxToken-authed `303` on `marketplace.mendix.com` → public CDN, no token sent to the CDN). `mxcli marketplace install <id> -p app.mpr` is type-aware: widgets are copied into `widgets/`, new modules are imported via `mx module-import`, other types are downloaded with import instructions. Module **updates** are intentionally reported-not-applied — re-importing an existing module would discard local edits and change persistent-entity IDs (data loss); that path is left to Studio Pro pending an ID-preserving merge
- **Marketplace search caching** — the first `mxcli marketplace search` fetches the full catalog listing once and caches it under `~/.mxcli/marketplace-catalog-<profile>.json` (24h TTL, mode 0600); subsequent searches (any keyword) are served from the cache instantly. `--refresh` bypasses the cache and re-fetches. An interactive progress line ("Searching marketplace… N items scanned") shows during a fresh scan
- **`describe` auto-detects the document type** — the type is now optional for a qualified name: `mxcli describe MyModule.Customer` resolves the type itself (entity, microflow, page, snippet, enumeration, constant, java action, nanoflow, workflow, association incl. cross-module, …). Resolution prefers the catalog cache (O(1) lookup, no overhead vs. the explicit form) and falls back to a live project scan when the catalog is absent. An ambiguous name (e.g. an entity and a microflow sharing a name) is reported with its candidates. The explicit `describe <type> <name>` form is unchanged, and is still required for the forms that have no single qualified name (module, settings, navigation, module role)
- **Bare `describe Module.Name` works as MDL, not just as a CLI flag** — the auto-detect form is now part of the MDL grammar, so it parses and runs everywhere MDL does: the REPL, `exec` scripts, `check`, and the LSP (previously `describe Sales.Order` in the REPL was a parse error and only `mxcli describe Sales.Order` worked). The bare form resolves the type from the project's catalog `objects` index at execution time (built on demand, fresh — no staleness concern); all typed `describe <type> …` forms still take precedence, and an ambiguous or unknown name returns an actionable error

### Changed

- **Catalog `objects` index includes associations** — the unified `objects` view now unions the `associations` table (`ObjectType = ASSOCIATION`), so it is a complete index for the cataloged document types and consumers no longer need a separate associations query. Catalog schema bumped to v3; cached `.mxcli/catalog.db` files rebuild automatically on the next `refresh catalog`.
- **Catalog indexes image collections, JavaScript actions, and data transformers** — these document types had no catalog table at all; they are now built (via the raw-unit surface, so no `CatalogReader`/backend change) into their own tables and unioned into `objects` (`IMAGE_COLLECTION`, `JAVASCRIPT_ACTION`, `DATA_TRANSFORMER`). `describe` auto-detect resolves image collections and data transformers by bare name. Catalog schema bumped to v4.
- **Catalog indexes agent-editor documents** — agents, AI models, knowledge bases, and consumed MCP services (one shared `CustomBlobDocuments$CustomBlobDocument` BSON wrapper, distinguished by `CustomDocumentType`) are now cataloged into their own tables and unioned into `objects` (`AGENT`, `AI_MODEL`, `KNOWLEDGE_BASE`, `CONSUMED_MCP_SERVICE`). The document name turned out to be a top-level wrapper field (not buried in the inner JSON blob), so this reads through the raw-unit surface with no `CatalogReader`/backend change, and `describe` auto-detect resolves all four by bare name. Catalog schema bumped to v5; this completes the `objects` index for the document types tracked in #658. (Verified against `test3-app`: 8 agent-editor docs across all four types.)

### Fixed

- **`show context` now resolves its relationship sections** — the sections filtered the refs table on `TargetType`/`SourceType` using lowercase literals (`'entity'`, `'microflow'`, `'page'`) while those values are stored uppercase, so in case-sensitive SQLite "Entities Used", "Microflows Using This Entity", "Pages Displaying This Entity", "Related Entities" and the workflow context sections silently rendered empty. Now matched correctly. (`show callers|callees|references|impact` were unaffected and already pick up the expanded refs automatically.)
- **`catalog.refs` captures far more references** — the cross-reference index that powers `show callers|callees|references|impact` was missing whole categories (#663). Now added: nanoflow calls, consumed-REST-operation calls, and association-based retrieves from microflow actions; **nanoflows as reference sources** (previously only microflows were walked); **association references** (each association now links to both its FROM and TO entity — was an explicit `// Skipping for now` TODO); **page→layout references** (the emission was dead code gated behind an always-nil `LayoutCall`); **calculated-by** (entity→microflow for calculated attributes); **change/delete entity references** (resolved via lightweight intra-flow variable tracking); and **page-widget references** — `datasource` (page→entity) and `action` (page→microflow/nanoflow), extracted from the existing raw-BSON widget walk and projected from `widgets_data` (new `MicroflowRef`/`NanoflowRef` columns). On `MxGraphStudioDemo` the earlier slice took `associate` 0→104, `layout` 0→22; on `Evora-FactoryManagement` the full effort took `refs` from ~5.5k to 6,459. Re-run `refresh catalog full` to pick them up. (Snippet-widget refs remain a follow-up — snippets don't yet feed `widgets_data`.)
- **`catalog.activities` labels REST and other actions correctly instead of a generic `MicroflowAction`** — the `ActionType` column came from a hand-maintained type switch that only knew ~17 action types; every other parser-modelled action (REST call, REST operation call, web-service call, nanoflow call, JavaScript-action call, execute-database-query, transform-JSON, XML import/export, show-home-page, delete-object) silently collapsed into `ActionType = 'MicroflowAction'`, so e.g. `select … from CATALOG.activities where ActionType = 'RestCallAction'` returned nothing. The label is now derived from the concrete action type, so it stays correct for every action the parser models (including ones added later), and an action the parser doesn't model yet surfaces its real Mendix storage name rather than a generic bucket. On `MxGraphStudioDemo` the generic bucket dropped from 33 rows to 0, exposing RestCallAction/RestOperationCallAction/JavaScriptActionCallAction/NanoflowCallAction/DeleteObjectAction that were previously hidden. Re-run `refresh catalog full` to pick up the corrected labels.
- **`SHOW CATALOG TABLES` lists every catalog view** — the table list was hand-maintained and had drifted: the newly-cataloged document-type views (image collections, JavaScript actions, data transformers, agents, AI models, knowledge bases, consumed MCP services) and the pre-existing `navigation_profiles` view were all built and queryable but never shown. They are now listed, and a drift-guard test (`TestTables_CoversAllViews`) asserts every catalog VIEW appears in the list, so a future document type can't be silently omitted again.
- **`refresh catalog source` no longer O(N²) on large projects** — it resolved each document by re-reading and re-`bson.Unmarshal`ing *every* unit on *every* describe call, so a big app (#651: ~3.3k microflows, ~33k activities) took ~6 hours. The reader now builds a one-time `$Type + qualified-name → unit` index (decoding only the `Name` field, not the whole document), making `GetRawUnitByName` / `GetRawMicroflowByName` O(1); the shared backend means the index is built once across the parallel describe workers. The source phase also reports incremental progress every 2s instead of going silent for the whole build. GraphViewer's source build (993 microflows) dropped to ~3.5 min with live progress; cloud-portal-scale projects go from hours to minutes
- **Marketplace search now scans the whole catalog** — the Content API has no server-side search and caps `limit` at 100 per page, so `marketplace search` previously only filtered the first 100 items and silently missed matches further in (e.g. External Database Connector `219862`, Mendix Business Events `202649`). It now paginates via `offset`, fetching pages **concurrently** (first page alone so a common early match stays a single request; then bounded-parallel batches), and stops at `--limit` matches or end-of-catalog. Measured ~3m45s → ~44s on a slow link for a deep match; combined with the new cache, repeat searches are instant

## [0.12.0] - 2026-06-04

Headline: **one widget creation path.** The `datagrid`/`gallery`/`combobox`/`image` keywords and the `pluggablewidget '...'` form now build BSON through a single registry-driven engine, fed by widget definitions extracted from each project's installed `.mpk` files (`widget init`; auto-generated/refreshed on `exec`). The Mendix BSON *envelope* still comes from embedded `mendix-11.6` templates — full per-version, project-extracted templates remain tracked under #529.

### Added

- **Cross-version widget-envelope drift gate** — `make check-widget-versions` (script `scripts/check-widget-versions.sh`) runs a widget fixture through `exec` + `mx check` on multiple Mendix versions and fails if the CE0463 set differs between them (v0.12.0 Stream A). It drops each fixture's `create module` targets before exec so leftover/divergent reference-project state doesn't skew the comparison; the 11.10 libSkiaSharp crash is handled automatically via `scripts/mx-check.sh`. Fixture set: `03`, `30`, `31`, `32`. The gate surfaced one real 11.9→11.10 drift (textfilter `attrChoice`, #605, fixed above); after that fix all four fixtures pass with no cross-version drift

### Security

- **Go toolchain pinned to 1.26.4** — resolves two reachable standard-library vulnerabilities flagged by `govulncheck`: GO-2026-5039 (`net/textproto`, unescaped inputs in errors; reached via `mpk.ParseMPK`) and GO-2026-5037 (`crypto/x509`, inefficient candidate hostname parsing). `go.mod` now carries a `toolchain go1.26.4` directive and CI pins `go-version: '1.26.4'`, so every environment builds with the fixed stdlib

### Changed

- **ALTER STYLING design properties** — `ALTER STYLING` now writes design properties on pages and snippets, with correct value-type encoding (Option vs Custom; ToggleButtonGroup uses Option). `DESCRIBE STYLING` round-trips them. (#631)
- **Dependency bumps** — `chroma/v2` 2.24.1 → 2.26.1, `modernc.org/sqlite` 1.50.1 → 1.51.0, `mattn/go-runewidth` 0.0.23 → 0.0.24
- **DataGrid construction unified on the pluggable widget engine** — the `datagrid` MDL keyword now routes through the same registry-driven engine as the `pluggablewidget 'com.mendix.widget.web.datagrid.Datagrid'` form, so both produce equivalent BSON. The hand-coded keyword-path builder (`datagrid_builder.go` `BuildDataGrid2Widget` + ~30 helpers, ~990 lines) is deleted. Engine gained the column conventions the keyword path applied implicitly: CONTROLBAR→filtersPlaceholder routing, per-column filter-widget routing (`textfilter`/`numberfilter`/`datefilter`/`dropdownfilter`), object-list item property ordering, `Caption`/`Content` aliases with `CaptionParams`/`ContentParams` resolution, missing-Caption→attribute-name fallback, attribute-less columns default `sortable=false`, content-slot widgets auto-infer `ShowContentAs: customContent`, and the tooltip/exportValue empty-ClientTemplate conventions. (#529 Phase 4)
- **Catalog schema normalized** — every domain table (entities, microflows, pages, …) is now split into a `<name>_data` storage table plus a `<name>` view that joins `snapshots` to expose `ProjectName`, `SnapshotDate`, `SnapshotSource`, `SourceId`, `SourceBranch`, `SourceRevision`. Existing queries (`SELECT * FROM CATALOG.ENTITIES`, ad-hoc filters by `SnapshotSource`, the `objects` UNION view) keep working unchanged. Existing `.mxcli/catalog.db` files rebuild automatically on first open (schema version bumped to 2); cache metadata is cleared so the rebuild fires through `isCacheValid`. (#576)

### Fixed

- **DESCRIBE round-trips for pages and widgets** — `DESCRIBE` now emits re-executable MDL for several cases that previously broke a roundtrip: bare grant member names (#633), `microflow`/`nanoflow` (not `call_`) for widget actions (#634), an always-present java-action body (#637), quoted reserved-keyword DataGrid column names (#638), and widget-action microflow arguments as `Param: value` (#640)
- **Reserved-keyword names via quoting** — page/snippet parameter names (#114) and widget names (#619) that collide with MDL reserved words can now be expressed with quoting instead of being rejected
- **OQL against Mendix 11.11** — `mxcli oql` supports the new `/dev/preview_execute_oql` dev endpoint and surfaces its query errors (which arrive as HTTP 200 with an `{"error": ...}` body) instead of silently succeeding
- Filter widgets (`textfilter`/`numberfilter`/`datefilter`/`dropdownfilter`) with an explicit `attributes: [...]` list now emit `attrChoice="linked"` instead of `"auto"` (#605). `"auto"` is correct only for a *bare* filter inside a DataGrid column (it binds to the column's attribute); a filter with an explicit attributes list (e.g. inside a Gallery `filter` block) needs `"linked"`. Mendix 11.10+ flags `attrChoice="auto"` alongside a populated attributes list as definition drift (CE0463); Mendix 11.9 tolerated it. This was real 11.9→11.10 envelope drift that the v0.12.0 Stream A gate missed because its fixtures only exercised column-bound filters
- DataGrid column `ColumnWidth: manual` is honoured again — the Stream B engine consolidation dropped the keyword path's `ColumnWidth` → schema `width` mapping, leaving width at its `autoFill` default. A `Size:` value is only valid when `width=manual`, so under autoFill Studio Pro / `mx check` flagged CE0463. Restored as a `width ← ColumnWidth` column alias (caught by the new cross-version gate as `dgDyn` in fixture 31)
- Pluggable widget property conditional visibility (#574) — a TextTemplate property hidden by the widget's `editorConfig.js` under the current configuration now emits `TextTemplate: null` instead of the template's populated default, eliminating CE0463 ("the definition of this widget has changed"). Phase 1 hand-authors rules for VideoPlayer (`videoUrl`/`posterUrl` hidden when `type=expression`) and Timeline (`title`/`description`/`timeIndication` hidden when `customVisualization=true`); rules live in each widget's `.def.json` as a `propertyVisibility[]` block and ride the `generatorVersion` auto-refresh
- `mxcli exec` now generates **missing** widget definitions, not just refreshes stale ones — a project that has `.mpk` widgets installed but was never `widget init`-ed (no `.mxcli/widgets/`) previously failed the first widget build with "unsupported widget type: datagrid". `exec` now extracts the defs from the installed `.mpk` files on demand (matching `refresh catalog`), so it works without a separate `widget init` step
- Stale project-local widget definitions self-heal — `.def.json` files carry a `generatorVersion` stamp, and `mxcli exec` re-extracts any definition generated by an older engine before building widgets. Projects whose `.mxcli/widgets/` was generated before the v0.12.0 widget changes no longer emit CE0463 ("widget definition changed") on the next run without a manual `widget init --force`
- DataGrid filter widgets (`textfilter`/`numberfilter`/`datefilter`/`dropdownfilter`) default `attrChoice` to `auto` instead of `linked`/`custom`, so a filter placed inside a column body binds to the column's attribute automatically rather than failing `mx check` with CE0642 ("Property 'Attribute' is required")

## [0.11.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- **Pluggable widget property validation** — `mxcli check` flags unknown widget property keys as `MDL-WIDGET01`; respects MDL builtin property names (e.g. `Label`, `Caption`, `DataSource`) so they aren't reported as typos
- **`mxcli check --post-migration`** — scans for legacy native widgets in pages/snippets and reports `MDL-WIDGET02` with qualified module.document names; version-gated via the legacy-widget catalog
- **LSP widget integration** — completion suggests widget property keys inside `(...)` blocks; hover shows property descriptions extracted from `.mpk`; widget property typos surface as real-time diagnostics
- **Widget definition workflow** — `widget init --force` re-extracts existing `.def.json` files; `widget init` and `refresh catalog` auto-refresh stale definitions; `mxcli init` now runs `widget init` so new projects pick up widget defs automatically
- **Catalog: widget tables** — `widget_definitions` and `widget_definition_properties` queryable via `SELECT ... FROM CATALOG.widget_definitions`
- **`ALTER` for agent-editor documents** — `ALTER AGENT/MODEL/KNOWLEDGEBASE/MCPSERVICE` (#464)
- **Skill docs include MDL keyword routing** — generated widget skill files document object-list and child-slot keywords driven from `.def.json`

### Fixed

- DataGrid2 column `tooltip` / `exportValue` / `dynamicText` TextTemplate now matches Studio Pro's per-column-kind convention (CE0463 on attribute-bound columns, #578)
- DataGrid2 column `CaptionParams` / `ContentParams` / `ShowContentAs` / `Content` roundtrip (#547); `$localVar` references in column captions emit `Forms$PageVariable.LocalVariable`
- Pluggable widget engine wrote `CustomWidgets$AttributeRef` (not a registered Mendix type); now emits `DomainModels$AttributeRef` with the fully-qualified path so `mx update-widgets` no longer fails with `TypeCacheUnknownTypeException` (#64)
- Object-list item TextTemplate slots emit `null` when unset (Accordion `groups`, Maps `markers`, AreaChart `series`, PopupMenu items) instead of placeholder ClientTemplate that triggered CE0463 (#548)
- Pluggable widget CE0463 on Mendix 11.9 — `FormattingInfo TimeFormat` + `Selection` PascalCase normalization
- DataView `FormOrientation` / `LabelWidth` now controllable from MDL (#554)
- `ALTER PAGE` fixes: `INSERT`/`REPLACE` serializes DataGrid2 columns correctly; `set Title` actually updates the title (#561); column `SET` is case-insensitive and supports TextTemplate captions (#560); column inserts use the grid's data source as entity context
- Master-detail page round-trip — Gallery `ItemSelectionMode` + DataView selection-source described correctly
- `DesktopWidth` / `TabletWidth` / `PhoneWidth`: `AutoFill` now actually sets `Weight: -1` instead of dropping the override
- Pluggable widget validator respects MDL builtin property names (no false positives on `Label:`, `Caption:`, `DataSource:`, etc.)
- `mxcli check` detects custom-content column INSERT issues before MxBuild
- `--references` no longer flags `DROP + CREATE` of the same name as a conflict
- Reject Mendix reserved words on non-persistent entity attributes (#552)
- Cached catalog applies the current schema on load (no more "no such table" after schema bump)
- Nightly CE0117 on Mendix 10.24.19 — drop redundant `toString()` on string parameter

### Changed

- Test infrastructure: `TestMain` runs `widget init` on the shared source project so per-test copies inherit `.def.json` files; integration tests now exercise pluggable widget fixtures end-to-end
- Robust cleanup for doctype/mx-check tests eliminates ENOTEMPTY flake on CI
- `modernc.org/sqlite` bumped from 1.50.0 to 1.50.1

### Known limitations

- Two CE0463 cases remain for widgets with property-conditional TextTemplate visibility (VideoPlayer with `type='expression'`, Timeline with `customVisualization='true'`). Root cause and proposal in `docs/11-proposals/PROPOSAL_widget_property_visibility.md`; tracked under #574
- `pluggablewidget 'com.mendix.widget.web.datagrid.Datagrid'` form is less feature-complete than the `datagrid` keyword form (no CONTROLBAR/customContent/per-column filter routing). Tracked under #529 Phase 4

## [0.10.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- **Maven/JAR dependency management** — `CREATE/DROP/SHOW JAR DEPENDENCY` statements; `jar_dependencies` catalog table; skill and docs-site pages (MDL-JARDEP)
- **Object-list pluggable widget properties** — grammar keywords for object-list blocks, extraction to `.def.json` (Phase 1), and BSON serialization through the executor (Phase 1 Layer 3)
- **LEGACYDATAGRID grammar** — keyword dispatch table and `LEGACYDATAGRID` grammar rule (Phase 2 pluggable widget overhaul)
- **`AllowCreateChangeLocally` flag** — exposed on external OData entities (#534)
- **Catalog: contract_entities → external_entities link** — cross-reference between contract catalog and integration catalog
- **`not(expr)` grammar enforcement** — grammar now requires parenthesised form; bare `not expr` rejected with CE0117 diagnostic

### Fixed

- ALTER SNIPPET failing with "page not found" (#402)
- `SHOW CONTEXT OF` entity showing empty definition (#396)

- `CATALOG.JAR_DEPENDENCIES` missing from `Tables()` list
- Three nightly CI failures on Mendix 10.24
- DataGrid2 `WidgetObject` boolean defaults aligned with `PropertyType` schema
- `TextTemplate` translation defaults populated; `Editable=Always` set on filters
- Required `CustomWidget` envelope fields added to filter widgets
- `WidgetObject Properties` reordered to match `WidgetType PropertyTypes` order
- `AllowUpload` field added to `WidgetValueType` BSON (closes one CE0463 gap)
- Unique placeholder IDs for `TextTemplate` translations (#30)
- Two ALTER PAGE bugs caught in test feedback
- ComboBox CE0463 — guard auto-populate and null `selectAllButtonCaption`
- Grammar added as explicit dependency of `build`, `test`, and `release` targets

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- **Inheritance split and cast** — `CASE $var IS Module.SubType THEN ... END CASE` and `CAST $var AS Module.SubType` statements in microflow/nanoflow bodies; full BSON roundtrip with branch anchors, nested continuation cases, and merge emission (CE0079)
- **CREATE OR MODIFY** — Standardised `OR MODIFY` variant across all remaining document types so scripts are idempotent by default (#510)
- **MDL-DUPDEF** — `mxcli check` detects duplicate `CREATE` for the same qualified name and reports `MDL-DUPDEF`

### Fixed

- REST mapping cardinality not roundtripping — `as list of` syntax now parsed and emitted (#519)
- Import mapping: `MinOccurs`/`MaxOccurs` not parsed on mapping elements; repeating Object root treated as list; `SingleObject` inferred when `JsonStructure` absent
- Microflow layout: spacing, branch heights, and loop containment improved
- `TEXTFILTER` inside `DATAGRID COLUMN` not wired to the column filter slot (#189)
- `SET $obj/Assoc` path target rejected and produced wrong BSON (#511)

- `mxcli check --references` reporting false positives on `System.*` references (#523)
- ANTLR4 version unpinned in CI caused flaky Maven Central lookup failures

### Changed

- Generated ANTLR parser removed from git; `make grammar` step added to CI (#514)
- `MDLParser.g4` split into domain-specific grammar files for maintainability (#515)

## [0.8.0] - 2026-05-05

- **Free microflow annotations** — Unattached `@annotation` nodes in microflow bodies survive describe → exec round-trip
- **@anchor sequence flow annotation** — `@anchor(from: X, to: Y)` on microflow statements pins SequenceFlow attachment sides; split and loop forms supported; builder-default and layout-equivalent anchors suppressed from DESCRIBE output
